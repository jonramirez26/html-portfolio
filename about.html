<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2><p>Hi, I'm Jon Ramirez.</p></h2> 

<p>My current position is an Implementations Project Manager at Carta, with a passion for creating seamless user experiences. With a solid background in both UX design and full-stack web development.</p>

<p>Recently graduating from a rigorous UX Design boot camp, I've honed the ability to empathize with users and translate their needs into intuitive and visually appealing interfaces. They understand the importance of conducting thorough user research and testing to ensure optimal user experiences.</p>

<p>Not content with stopping there, I went on to complete a Full-Stack Web Developer boot camp, expanding my technical repertoire. Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I leverage these fundamental languages to build dynamic and responsive web applications. I'm also well-versed in React, Node, MongoBD,Web3 and DApps.</p>

<p>Additionally, due to my experience as an Implementations Project Manager at Carta, I bring a unique perspective to project planning and execution. My knowledge in UX design and full-stack development allows me to bridge the gap between technical implementation and user-centric design, ensuring that projects are delivered efficiently and meet the highest standards of quality.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read a litte bit about myself and my background.</p>
